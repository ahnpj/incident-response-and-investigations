# Web Application Authentication Compromise Investigation (Brute-Force Attempts and Account Compromise Detection)

**Category:** Web Application Compromise  
**Primary Attack Surface:** Web application authentication endpoints  
**Tactics Observed:** Credential Access, Initial Access, Persistence  
**Primary Data Sources:** Web Application Authentication Logs, HTTP Access Logs, Application Event Records

This investigation analyzes abuse of a web application’s authentication mechanism that resulted in automated credential attacks, successful account compromise, and subsequent credential reuse from multiple sources.

The analysis focuses on reconstructing attacker behavior using application-layer authentication logs and HTTP request metadata to identify how accounts were enumerated, how credentials were abused, and how insecure credential handling within application logs contributed to successful compromise.

The investigation demonstrates how an analyst:

- Identifies automated authentication abuse using source IP and request frequency
- Differentiates enumeration activity from targeted credential attacks
- Confirms account compromise using authentication success patterns
- Detects credential reuse from secondary sources
- Identifies insecure logging practices that expose sensitive credentials

## What This Investigation Covers

This case analyzes post-incident authentication telemetry captured by a Linux-based web application. The dataset represents application-layer logs generated by the login endpoint during an active credential abuse campaign.

The investigation walks through how the analyst:

- Attributes high-volume authentication failures to a single external IP
- Identifies scripted behavior using consistent User-Agent strings
- Distinguishes attempts against non-existent and valid accounts
- Confirms successful authentication following repeated failures
- Identifies credential reuse from a different source IP
- Determines that all activity targeted a single authentication endpoint (`/api/login`)
- Confirms that credential material was logged in a reversible encoded format
- Recovers the plaintext password from logged authentication data

Rather than focusing on exploit development, the walkthrough emphasizes how **observable application telemetry** can be used to fully reconstruct credential-based attacks.

## Environment, Data Sources, and Tools

This investigation analyzes application-layer authentication abuse rather than host-level compromise or malware execution. The focus is on identifying automated login activity, account enumeration, credential compromise, and insecure credential handling using web application authentication telemetry.

### At-a-Glance Summary

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Environment Type** | Linux-based web application (authentication abuse case) |
| **Affected Assets** | Application authentication accounts and login workflow targeted by automated attempts |
| **Primary Platforms / Services** | Web application authentication service; application logging framework (JSON logs); centralized log analysis platform |
| **Telemetry Sources Reviewed** | Application authentication logs (JSON records); HTTP request metadata; encoded credential fields within log records |
| **Evidence Types** | High-volume failed logins + eventual success; repeated patterns consistent with automation; decoded/normalized fields used to confirm attacker behavior |
| **Tools Used** | Splunk (SPL queries for brute-force patterning + pivots); Visual Studio Code (JSON review/search); CyberChef (decode/transform encoded fields); manual timeline reconstruction |
| **Investigation Focus** | Prove credential brute force led to valid access and establish scope/sequence of compromise from authentication telemetry |

### Operating Systems

- **Affected System (Victim Environment):**  
  Linux-based web application server hosting the authentication service targeted by automated login attempts.

- **Analyst Environment:**  
  Windows-based analyst workstation used for log parsing, decoding, and timeline reconstruction.

### Platforms and Services

- **Web Application Authentication Service**  
  Generated login telemetry capturing usernames, authentication outcomes, and failure reasons, which was used to identify brute-force behavior and account enumeration.

- **Application Logging Framework (JSON Logs)**  
  Recorded structured authentication events, including encoded credential fields that were later decoded to validate credential exposure.

- **Centralized Log Analysis Platform**  
  Used to search, filter, and correlate authentication events across large volumes of application telemetry.

### Data Sources Reviewed

- **Application Authentication Logs (JSON Records)**  
  Reviewed to identify:
  - Repeated failed login attempts
  - Targeting of non-existent vs valid accounts
  - Successful authentication following brute-force patterns
  - Subsequent credential reuse events

- **HTTP Request Metadata**  
  Reviewed to analyze:
  - Authentication endpoint usage
  - User-Agent strings associated with automated tooling
  - Request frequency and timing patterns

- **Encoded Credential Fields in Log Records**  
  Examined to determine whether passwords were:
  - Securely hashed
  - Or reversibly encoded and recoverable

### Tools and Analysis Techniques

- **Splunk (SPL Queries)**  
  Used to:
  - Aggregate authentication attempts by source IP
  - Identify spikes in failed login activity
  - Pivot between usernames and authentication outcomes
  - Reconstruct brute-force and credential reuse timelines

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  Used to:
  - Inspect raw JSON log files
  - Manually verify authentication event structure
  - Identify encoded credential fields within log entries

- **CyberChef**  
  Used to:
  - Decode Base64-encoded password values
  - Confirm that plaintext credentials could be recovered from logs

- **Manual Timeline Reconstruction**  
  Used to correlate:
  - Enumeration activity
  - Successful logins
  - Credential reuse from different IP addresses

This investigation demonstrates how application-layer logs alone can provide sufficient visibility to confirm account compromise and identify insecure credential handling practices without requiring host-level telemetry.
