# Web Application Authentication Compromise Investigation (Brute-Force Attempts and Account Compromise Detection)

**Category:** Web Application Compromise  
**Primary Attack Surface:** Web application authentication endpoints  
**Tactics Observed:** Credential Access, Initial Access, Persistence  
**Primary Data Sources:** Web Application Authentication Logs, HTTP Access Logs, Application Event Records

---

### Overview

This investigation analyzes abuse of a web application’s authentication mechanism that resulted in automated credential attacks, successful account compromise, and subsequent credential reuse from multiple sources.

The analysis focuses on reconstructing attacker behavior using application-layer authentication logs and HTTP request metadata to identify how accounts were enumerated, how credentials were abused, and how insecure credential handling within application logs contributed to successful compromise.

The investigation demonstrates how an analyst:
- Identifies automated authentication abuse using source IP and request frequency
- Differentiates enumeration activity from targeted credential attacks
- Confirms account compromise using authentication success patterns
- Detects credential reuse from secondary sources
- Identifies insecure logging practices that expose sensitive credentials

> 👉 **Follow the investigation walkthrough first**  
Begin with `investigation-walkthrough.md` inside an investigation folder to see how I identified, pivoted on, and validated evidence step by step.

> 👉 **Review findings and conclusions**  
Move to the `case-report.md` and `incident-summary.md` to understand what happened, what was confirmed, and why it mattered — from both technical and high-level perspectives.

> 👉 **Dig into evidence and detections**  
For deeper technical detail, review the `detection-artifact-report.md`, supporting screenshots, and extracted artifacts to see exactly how conclusions were supported by telemetry.

> 👉 **See defensive takeaways**  
Finish with `detection-and-hardening-recommendations.md` and `mitre-attack-mapping.md` to understand how observed attacker behavior maps to MITRE ATT&CK and where detection or control improvements were identified.

> 👉 **Use this repository as case-based learning**  
These investigations are designed to be read like **real SOC case files**, showing not just *what* happened, but *how* an analyst reasoned through the incident using multiple data sources.

### What This Investigation Covers

This case analyzes post-incident authentication telemetry captured by a Linux-based web application. The dataset represents application-layer logs generated by the login endpoint during an active credential abuse campaign.

The investigation attributes high-volume authentication failures to a single external IP, identifies scripted behavior using consistent User-Agent strings, distinguishes attempts against non-existent and valid accounts, confirms successful authentication following repeated failures, identifies credential reuse from a different source IP, determines that all activity targeted a single authentication endpoint (`/api/login`), confirms that credential material was logged in a reversible encoded format, and recovers the plaintext password from logged authentication data.

Rather than focusing on exploit development, the walkthrough emphasizes how observable application telemetry can be used to fully reconstruct credential-based attacks.

### Environment, Data Sources, and Tools

This investigation analyzes application-layer authentication abuse rather than host-level compromise or malware execution. The focus is on identifying automated login activity, account enumeration, credential compromise, and insecure credential handling using web application authentication telemetry.

#### Environment and Investigation Scope (At a Glance)

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Environment Type** | Linux-based web application (authentication abuse case) |
| **Affected Assets** | Application authentication accounts and login workflow targeted by automated attempts |
| **Victim Operating System** | Linux-based web application server hosting the authentication service |
| **Analyst Operating System** | Windows-based analyst workstation used for log parsing, decoding, and timeline reconstruction |
| **Primary Platforms / Services** | Web application authentication service, application logging framework (JSON logs), centralized log analysis platform |
| **Investigation Focus** | Prove credential brute force led to valid access and establish scope and sequence of compromise from authentication telemetry |

#### Data Sources, Evidence, and Analysis Techniques

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Primary Telemetry Sources** | Application authentication logs (JSON records), HTTP request metadata, and encoded credential fields within log records |
| **Authentication Pattern Evidence** | High-volume failed logins, targeting of non-existent versus valid accounts, and successful authentication following brute-force patterns |
| **Automation Indicators** | Consistent User-Agent strings, uniform request timing, and endpoint-specific targeting of `/api/login` |
| **Credential Reuse Evidence** | Successful authentication from secondary IP addresses using previously compromised credentials |
| **Insecure Logging Evidence** | Encoded credential material logged in a reversible format, enabling recovery of plaintext passwords |
| **Splunk Correlation Techniques** | Aggregation of authentication attempts by source IP, spike detection for failed logins, pivots between usernames and outcomes, and timeline reconstruction |
| **VS Code Usage** | Inspection of raw JSON log files, validation of event structure, and identification of encoded credential fields |
| **CyberChef Usage** | Decoding Base64-encoded password values to confirm credential exposure |
| **Manual Timeline Correlation** | Correlation of enumeration, successful logins, and credential reuse across time and source IPs |
| **Operational Workflow Context** | Demonstrates how application telemetry alone can confirm account compromise and credential handling failures without host telemetry |

This investigation demonstrates how application-layer logs alone can provide sufficient visibility to confirm account compromise and identify insecure credential handling practices.

### Intended Use

This investigation demonstrates application-layer incident analysis using authentication telemetry and HTTP metadata. It reflects how credential abuse patterns are validated, documented, and translated into containment and application hardening actions.

### Relevance to Security Operations

Credential-based attacks remain one of the most common and impactful intrusion vectors against web applications.

This investigation demonstrates how defenders can detect automated authentication abuse, identify enumeration behavior, confirm account compromise and credential reuse, and detect insecure credential handling practices. Correlating these signals enables earlier detection, faster containment, and improved hardening of authentication controls.
